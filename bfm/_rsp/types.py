"""Core result types.

Array dtypes follow the call's `precision` (float32 by default in this
package; "float64" opt-in enables x64 at the entry point, never at import).
Permutations are zero-based (T, q) bijections.

PyTree contract: numeric, run-dependent arrays live in leaf
fields (children); `diagnostics` and `metadata` are flattened into sorted
tuples of hashable scalars or scalar sequences as aux data, so two
independent results with equal configuration compare equal and can enter the
same jit-compiled function repeatedly. Unsupported values in those dicts
raise a TypeError with guidance.

    """Result of an RSP alignment run.

    Losses are sums of squared Frobenius distances across draws, evaluated
    against the reference before or after each mean update.

    aligned_loadings:    (T, p, q) reordered draws.
    mean_loadings:       (p, q) mean of aligned draws.
    signs:               (T, q) int8 in {-1, +1}.
    permutations:        (T, q) int32 zero-based bijections.
    loss_initial:        f0 = sum_t ||A_t - M_0||_F^2 against the initial
                         reference; A_t are the optionally rotated inputs.
    loss_final:          sum_t ||aligned_t - mean_loadings||_F^2 after the
                         final mean update.
    loss_history:        (max_iter,) buffer; first n_iter entries: pre-update
                         objectives (R recording semantics).
    loss_history_post:   (max_iter,) buffer; objectives against each sweep's
                         updated mean.
    n_iter:              number of outer iterations actually run.
    converged:           stopping threshold was met (status_code == 1).
    status_code:         1 = converged, 2 = max_iter reached,
                         3 = anomaly, 4 = non-finite objective

                         non-finite intermediate appeared).
    transforms:          optional (T, q, q) full orthogonal transforms per draw;
                         None when return_transforms=False.
    varimax_n_iter:      optional (T,) int32 per-draw varimax iteration counts
                         (a count at the update limit indicates that the
                         iteration budget was exhausted; None when no
                         varimax pre-rotation ran). These counts do not
                         certify a local or global maximum of the varimax
                         criterion.
    diagnostics:         static configuration/scalars (hashable pairs in aux).
                         Includes `stop_reason` ("converged_threshold" /

                         by the output checks (an empty tuple otherwise).
    metadata:            MCMC metadata supplied by the caller
                         (``rsp_exact(..., metadata=...)``; the bfm estimators
                         fill it in align_factors): chain name, variable names,
